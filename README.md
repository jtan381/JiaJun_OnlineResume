## Description

This is a ReactJS based personal resume website. I have built this by following a <a href="https://github.com/tbakerx">template</a> by Tim Baker. This APP the data is fed directly from a JSON File.

## Requirement

### 1. Make sure you have what you need
To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can get it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">HERE</a>

### 2. Clone the repository.
Once you have a React app up and running by following the steps in the above link, download my code by hitting the green "clone or download" button above and hit download zip. All you will have to do now is replace the "public" and "src" folders of your newly built app with mine that you just downloaded. If you run npm start now, you should see that your app renders the same as the one at the live demo link below.

### 3. Enjoy the Resume Website
When you're all done, run npm start again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
